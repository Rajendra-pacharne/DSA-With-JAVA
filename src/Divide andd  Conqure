In Java, the terms "divide and conquer" refer to a problem-solving technique where a complex problem is divided into smaller subproblems, solved independently, and then combined to obtain the final solution. This technique is often used for solving algorithmic problems and can lead to more efficient and manageable code.

The divide and conquer approach typically involves three steps:

1. Divide: The problem is divided into smaller subproblems. This step breaks down the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem or related subproblems.

2. Conquer: Each subproblem is solved recursively. This step involves solving the smaller subproblems independently using the same divide and conquer approach.

3. Combine: The solutions of the subproblems are combined to obtain the final solution. This step involves merging the solutions of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem.

Here's an example of the divide and conquer technique in Java for finding the maximum element in an array:

```java
public class DivideAndConquerExample {
    public static int findMax(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) {
            // Base case: only one element in the array
            return arr[start];
        } else {
            // Divide the array into two halves
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;

            // Recursive calls to find the maximum in each half
            int max1 = findMax(arr, start, mid);
            int max2 = findMax(arr, mid + 1, end);

            // Combine the results by returning the maximum of the two halves
            return Math.max(max1, max2);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = { 2, 5, 1, 9, 7, 3, 6 };
        int max = findMax(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
        System.out.println("Maximum element: " + max);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `findMax` method takes an array, a start index, and an end index as parameters. It uses the divide and conquer approach to find the maximum element in the array.

If there's only one element in the array (base case), it simply returns that element. Otherwise, it divides the array into two halves, recursively finds the maximum in each half, and then combines the results by returning the maximum of the two halves using the `Math.max` function.

The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `findMax` method by creating an array and calling the method with the initial start and end indices of the array.

This example showcases how the divide and conquer technique breaks down a problem (finding the maximum element) into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines the results to obtain the final solution.
